# java-reservation-system

A personal java project to mess around with several new techniques. In this project I aim to
experiment and master the following things:

* Domain Driven Design patterns & heuristics
  * Aggregate Roots
  * Domain Events & Handlers
  * Value Objects
* Hexagonal Architecture
* Behaviour Driven Development
* Angular
* API Specifications
* Spring (Boot)
